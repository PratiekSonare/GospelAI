**Pratiek Sonare (22B2440)**
============================

**Final Year Undergraduate --- IIT Bombay**

My go-to bread & butter language for web development projects is **JavaScript**, and in this repository I've explored refactoring the project into two parts --- one implemented with **JS** and the other with **TS**.

**Motive**

A simple, minimilistic monochrome AI based writer assistant with different modes for enhancing contextual creative literature!
Equipped with:
-  Story Mode (for a 100 word story, based on query)
-  Dialogue Mode (given a context, generate what the next dialogue of the protagonist must be)
-  Random Mode (generate a 200 word short story for your intended genre and mood!)
